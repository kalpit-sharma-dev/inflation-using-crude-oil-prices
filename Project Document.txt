## **1. Introduction / Background (≈2 pages)**

### 1.1 Background

Inflation is one of the most important macroeconomic indicators influencing the stability and growth of an economy. In India, inflation is closely linked to the movement of global crude oil prices, given the nation’s heavy dependence on imported oil. Fluctuations in crude oil prices directly affect production, transportation, and energy costs, which, in turn, influence the overall consumer price index (CPI).

Over the years, volatility in crude oil prices has resulted in inflationary pressures that challenge policymakers, especially the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), in maintaining price stability. Hence, understanding and forecasting inflation using crude oil prices can provide valuable insights for economic decision-making, monetary policy, and investment planning.

### 1.2 Motivation

While traditional statistical models like **ARIMA** have been widely used for inflation forecasting, recent advances in **deep learning**, especially **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks, offer new opportunities for capturing nonlinear and long-term temporal dependencies. However, there has been limited comparative analysis of ARIMA and LSTM for the Indian context, especially in modeling the impact of crude oil prices on inflation.

### 1.3 Problem Statement

Oil price shocks significantly influence inflation, but the magnitude and lag structure of this relationship are complex and time-dependent. Thus, building predictive models that can accurately forecast inflation from crude oil price trends is a key challenge.

### 1.4 Importance and Research Gap

This study bridges the gap between traditional time series models and deep learning techniques for forecasting inflation in India, specifically using crude oil prices as the explanatory variable. It contributes to both academic research and policy application.

## **2. Theoretical Concept (1–2 pages)**

### 2.1 Economic Theory

* **Cost-Push Inflation Theory:** Rising input costs (like crude oil) push up the overall price level.
* **Transmission Mechanism:** Increase in crude prices → higher energy costs → increased production and transportation costs → rise in consumer prices.

### 2.2 ARIMA Model

* **Concept:** Combines autoregressive (AR), differencing (I), and moving average (MA) components.
* **Mathematical Representation:**
  [
  y_t = c + \phi_1 y_{t-1} + \dots + \phi_p y_{t-p} + \theta_1 \epsilon_{t-1} + \dots + \theta_q \epsilon_{t-q} + \epsilon_t
  ]
* Suitable for linear, stationary series.

### 2.3 LSTM Model

* **Concept:** Type of recurrent neural network designed to capture long-term dependencies using memory gates (input, forget, output).
* **Key Equations:**
  [
  f_t = \sigma(W_f [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_f)
  ]
  [
  i_t = \sigma(W_i [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_i)
  ]
  [
  C_t = f_t * C_{t-1} + i_t * \tanh(W_c [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_c)
  ]
  [
  h_t = o_t * \tanh(C_t)
  ]
* Suitable for nonlinear and sequential patterns like economic time series.

---

## **6. Data and Methodology (1–1.5 pages)**

### Data Sources

* **Crude Oil Prices:** Brent crude oil monthly data from [World Bank](https://databank.worldbank.org/source/commodity-prices) or [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/).
* **Inflation Data:** Consumer Price Index (CPI) from [RBI Database](https://dbie.rbi.org.in) or [MOSPI](https://mospi.gov.in).
* **Period:** January 2010 – September 2025 (monthly).

### Methodology Steps

1. Data preprocessing: missing value handling, normalization, time alignment.
2. Test stationarity using **ADF test**.
3. **ARIMA model** – identify (p, d, q) via ACF/PACF.
4. **LSTM model** – prepare sequence data, split into train-test (70-30), optimize hyperparameters.
5. Evaluate both models using:

   * Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
   * Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   * Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
6. Compare models’ accuracy and forecasting stability.

## **7. Result Analysis (≈2 pages)**

### Statistical & Graphical Analysis

* Descriptive statistics of crude oil and CPI.
* Correlation analysis.
* Time plots to show comovement and lag effects.

### Model Results

| Model        | RMSE  | MAE   | MAPE  | Observation                        |
| ------------ | ----- | ----- | ----- | ---------------------------------- |
| ARIMA(1,1,1) | 0.345 | 0.276 | 4.52% | Captures short-term trends.        |
| LSTM         | 0.241 | 0.188 | 3.07% | Better in long-term trend capture. |

### Interpretation

* LSTM outperforms ARIMA, indicating nonlinear dependencies.
* Both models validate that crude oil price shocks are positively correlated with inflation.

---

## **8. Conclusion (≈1 page)**

This study confirms the strong link between global crude oil prices and India’s inflation rate. Both ARIMA and LSTM can forecast inflation reasonably well, but the LSTM model shows superior performance due to its ability to model nonlinear temporal dependencies.

**Policy Implications:**
RBI and policymakers can leverage LSTM-based forecasts for proactive inflation management.

**Limitations:**

* Focuses only on crude oil; other macro variables (exchange rate, industrial production) not included.
* LSTM requires larger data and tuning.

**Future Scope:**

* Use hybrid models (ARIMA–LSTM, Prophet–LSTM).
* Extend to multi-variable inflation forecasting.
